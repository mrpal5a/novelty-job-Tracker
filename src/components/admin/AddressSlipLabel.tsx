// src/components/admin/AddressSlipLabel.tsx
// ============================================================
// The consignment address slip — BarTender's "ADDRESS 4 X 6.btw (NOVELTY
// LABELS)", 152.4 x 101.5 mm. One to a sheet, the whole 6" x 4".
// ============================================================
//
// WHY THIS ONE HAS NO TABLE AND NO JOB
// Every other slip in here describes what is inside the carton, so it is
// ruled into fields and reads off a job. This one is what a courier reads on
// the outside, and a courier wants two blocks of plain address text. There
// is nothing on it the app can derive: the destination is wherever this
// particular consignment is going, which is not a column on `jobs`. So both
// blocks are free text, and the slip prints without a job selected — the
// only tab on the page that works before a job is picked.
//
// WHY THE SENDER IS A CONSTANT AND THE DESTINATION IS NOT
// DEFAULT_FROM_ADDRESS is the factory. It is the same on every consignment
// that has ever left the building, so retyping it would be pure error
// surface — it is pre-filled and stays editable only so a one-off (a
// different shed, a changed mobile number) does not need a deploy.
//
// WHY THE BLOCKS ARE POSITIONED THE WAY THEY ARE
// Destination top-left, sender bottom-right, matching the original artwork
// and ordinary postal convention: the eye that matters is the courier's, and
// it goes to the top-left corner first. The sender block is pushed down by
// `margin-top: auto` rather than a measured offset so a long destination
// address grows downward into the gap instead of colliding with it.
//
// WHY THE BLOCKS CAN BE NUDGED
// That default is right for a five-line destination and wrong for a
// thirteen-line one, and there is no layout rule that gets both — how much
// room an address needs is a property of the address, which only the person
// typing it knows. So each block carries an offset in millimetres that the
// operator drags in the preview.
//
// The offset is a `translate`, deliberately, not a change to the margins:
// translation happens after layout, so nudging one block cannot reflow the
// other or change where the text wraps. The block you drag is the only thing
// that moves, and letting go of it at 0,0 restores exactly the artwork above.
//
// This component stays passive. It renders whatever offsets it is handed and
// reports where a drag started; every pixel-to-millimetre conversion and all
// the clamping lives in SlipsManager, so the print surface — which passes no
// handler — is inert and pixel-identical to the preview.
