-- LABEL PRINTING JOB TRACKING SYSTEM
-- Migration 007: label_stock
-- ============================================================
-- Physical stock of printed labels sitting in the shop. Consolidates
-- original migration 013, unchanged since.
--
-- Three ways stock appears, and they mean different things:
--   'Remaining' — the order was partially dispatched, so the balance of
--                 the printed run is still on the shelf. One row per job,
--                 recomputed on each partial dispatch, cleared when the
--                 job is fully dispatched (the labels left the building).
--   'Extra'     — surplus beyond the order quantity. The press over-ran,
--                 or a reprint left spares. Captured by Dispatch at full
--                 dispatch and NOT cleared by it — that is the whole
--                 point of tracking it.
--   'Manual'    — someone found stock the system never knew about.
--
-- Job identity is snapshotted onto the row rather than always read
-- through the join. Stock outlives the job it came from: a PO closed and
-- purged a year later must not silently blank the shelf record of 40,000
-- labels. job_id is kept (nullable) so live rows can still be traced to
-- the job.
